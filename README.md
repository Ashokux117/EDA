### Data cleaning or Data Cleasing Process...... 
Here, we clean the dataset. It was a completely raw dataset with several issues — many missing values and unwanted special characters.
We cleaned the data carefully and removed all such problems without losing any information.
Basically, we applied data cleaning techniques to make the dataset consistent and ready for further processing.

###  Steps Followed

**Step 1:** Import necessary libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy`.  

**Step 2:** Import the raw dataset into the Jupyter Notebook.  

**Step 3:** Read the dataset using pandas.  

**Step 4:** Check for missing values in numerical columns.  

**Step 5:** Fill the missing values in numerical columns.  

**Step 6:** Check for missing values in categorical columns.  

**Step 7:** Fill the missing values in categorical columns.  

**Step 8:** Convert the dataset format from Excel (`.xlsx`) to CSV (`.csv`).  

**Step 9:** Save the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_dataset.csv`.
